**Task:** Connect to the DataONE production environment, retrieve the list of nodes, and print out the list.

First, load the `dataone` R package:

```{r}
library(dataone)
```

Establish a connection to the CN in production environment:

```{r}
client <- D1Client() # See ?CNode for other environments
```

List the nodes in that environment with `listNodes`:

```{r}
nodes <- listMemberNodes(client)
```

Now we can print out the identifiers for each node:

```{r}
lapply(nodes, function(node) node@identifier)
```
